> What is Virtual Piggy?
Virtual Piggy is the first e-commerce solution that enables kids to manage and spend money within
a parent-controlled environment that also allows merchants to sell to them while complying with
the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). You can find out more about Virtual Piggy
and create an account by visiting http://www.virtualpiggy.com

> Why should I use Virtual Piggy in my Apps?
There are a number of reasons. The first being that usually when children are playing a mobile
game or using a mobile app they are restricted to no in-app purchasing or the parent actually has to
take over the app and perform the in-app purchase for the child. The second is that when a child is
left unattended they can inadvertently rack up hundreds of dollars worth of in-app purchases
without even realising it, usually the merchant has to refund these accidental transactions. Virtual
Piggy combats both of these problems as well as teaching the child responsible money management
along the way. Because the child has an allowance set by the parent the child cannot inadvertently
overspend and the child is free to make their own mind up about their purchases. The system is winwin
for parent, child and merchant.

> What is Virtual Piggy for the Marmalade SDK?
The Marmalade SDK is a cross platform mobile, desktop and emerging technology SDK that
enables developers to write apps once and deploy them to a multitude of platforms with very little
to no technical changes (see http://www.madewithmarmalade.com for more information). The
Virtual Piggy API for Marmalade is an API that sits on top of Marmalade that enables developers to
accept in-app purchases for virtual goods and subscriptions safely from children and parents.
